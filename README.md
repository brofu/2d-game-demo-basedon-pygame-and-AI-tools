# 2d-game-demo-basedon-pygame-and-AI-tools

This project is a quick 4 years old children friendly 2D shooting game demo based on `pygame` and `AI tools`

**Work Assited by `AI tools`**

1.  Based on the function description, generated the code snippet based on `pygame`. Assited by `ChatGPT-4`
2.  Provided possible reason to the problems / bugs of the code. Assited by `ChatGPT-4`
3.  Generated the images of demo, including the images of (Assited by `DALL.E3`): 
    *   Background
    *   The player
    *   The bullet
    *   The enemies
4.  Generated the music and sound effect of the demo, including:

    *   Shot sound effect. Get from `mixkit.co`
    *   Enemy killed sound effect. Get from `mixkit.co`
    *   Game over sound effect. Get from `mixkit.co`



**Work Mainly Depending on Human** 

1.  Python development env. Vim YouCompleteMe plugin trouble-shooting (AI helps on this part also)
2.  Reorginze the code a little bit. (The orgnization of the code snippet provided by `chatGPT` originally is just like a shit)
